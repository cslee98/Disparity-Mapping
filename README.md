# Disparity-Mapping
Mapping of two stereo images to calculate distance. 
Base offset = 74mm, camera logitech c270 focal length = 4.2mm, real-world distance = 31cm.
Fail to calculate distance between camera and objects using this formula D = (base offset * focal length) / disparity. 
Anyone can tell me why my disparity values can't give me the distance of 310mm? Thank You
